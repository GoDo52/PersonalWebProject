# Personal Finance Management App

## Overview

This project is my personal pet project â€” a simple CRUD application designed to help manage personal finances (or finances of a family/group of people). It allows users to track their spending habits by logging expenses, categorizing them, and viewing (so far) simple analytics to understand where their money goes. I wanted to build something practical, secure, and user-friendly while improving my skills in C#/ASP.NET Core development.

The app uses an N-tier architecture and it is built with ASP.NET Core MVC. It integrates well with Azure SQL Database for data storage and has role-based authentication and authorization. The project has essential features of a modern web app: simple and clean design, secure authentication, and effective data handling.
